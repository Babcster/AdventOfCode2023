# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles, written in Swift. The Advent of Code is an annual December event where participants solve daily coding puzzles. Each day has two parts, and each part grants a star upon completion. The goal is to collect all 50 stars by December 25th.

## Structure

The repository is structured by day, with each day's folder containing separate Swift playground files for each part of the day's challenge.


## Running the Solutions

To run the solutions, you will need:

- [Swift](https://swift.org/download/) installed on your machine.
- An IDE or text editor that supports Swift, such as [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

Clone the repository, navigate to the day's folder you wish to run, and open the Swift file in your preferred environment. You can then run the file to see the solution's output.

## Approach

For each puzzle, I aimed to write clear, efficient code, focusing on readability and simplicity. Where relevant, I've added comments to explain my thought process and the steps taken to solve the puzzle.

## Acknowledgments

- Thanks to [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), the creator of Advent of Code, for creating such an engaging and fun way to practice coding skills during the holiday season.
- A shoutout to the Swift and programming community for providing inspiration and resources that helped in solving these puzzles.
